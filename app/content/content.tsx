      Sports have always been a big part of my life — especially tennis, badminton, and table tennis. 
      I love the energy, focus, and occasional friendly rivalry that come with every game.

      I have a strong passion for language learning and have been studying Japanese independently for around five years, 
      driven by love and appreciation for Japanese culture and literature. 
      I’ve achieved JLPT N2 certification, which signifies an advanced level of proficiency in Japanese — the ability to comprehend complex written and spoken materials. 
      I enjoy reading Japanese novels and manga across a variety of genres, as a way to keep learning and stay connected with the language. 
      I might even pick up another language that sparks my interest in the near future.`;
